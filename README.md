# Text Formatter

This website aims to help you with tasks where text formatting is needed. 
It's not intended to replace a word processor, but the formatting tools 
available here can help speed up some jobs which might otherwise be long
and repetitive.

Text Formatter can also quickly tell you how many words and characters 
are there in your text.
